## Circuit Building  
### Creating Basic Circuits with Raspberry Pi  

Before we start making our connections from a Raspberry Pi (microcomputer) to a breadboard, we will learn and practice the basics of controlling electricity flow. This will include logic design (switching networks) and all of the devices involved; i.e. resistors, cables, buttons, and light emitting diodes (LEDs).
